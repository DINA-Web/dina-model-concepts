Component Description: Collecting Event
=======================

## Specific scope of the component

## What does the component do? (envisioned feature set)

### Definition

An action that occurs at some location during some time. (from Darwin Core)

### Has links to
* Files and multimedia
  * Document protocols (includes fieldnotes?) 
  * Image of the site
  * Collecting Permit
* Agents: participating agents with various roles depending on the nature of the participation
* Physical entity
* Catalogued objects
* Acquisitions ?
* Controlled vocabularies
  * Habitat classifications
  * Country names, water bodies etc
* Collecting Event (a parent or associated collecting event)

### Potential fields
* Date/time of the event
  * date/time ranges and partial date/time with uncertainty (e.g. 2020-02/2020-03)
* Location of the event
  * location of the locality specified according to some geodetic reference system, e.g. as latitude/longitude, UTM, decimal degrees, georeferenced polygons, transects, in each case with error estimates
  * process of the determination of the location of the locality - should be represented in terms of the type of procedure performed for the and the agent responsible for the determination
  * altitude specified according to some altitude reference system (can also be negative, i.e. depth for aquatic sites or caves)
  * different geometric figures (points, lines (transect), polygons (2d and 3D))
* Agents
  * various roles depending on the nature of the participation
  * ordering of the agents in a given activity must be preserved
  * same agent could have multiple roles in a given collecting event
* Verbatim values (date as written on the labels or any value before interpretation)
* Conditions during the collecting event / at the collection site (e.g. weather conditions)
* Quantify sampling effort, sample size & unit
