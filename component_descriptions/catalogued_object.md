Component Description: Catalogued Object
=======================

## Specific scope of the component

Objects are being catalogued in the context of a specific purpose and catalogue numbers are being assigned in order to reference and count the objects. The catalogued objects are usually being referenced for transanctions, inventories and to make them discoverable for research and exhibitions. 

## What does the component do? (envisioned feature set)

### Definition
Catalogued objects are [physical entities](physical_entity.md) or composites of many physical entities with associated catalogue numbers in a collection catalogue or inventory.
They are results of one or many [preparation process(es)](preparation_process.md) and may be composed of one or many parts, that are not necessarily from the same organism (e.g. herbarium sheet with leaves, flower and seeds; assembled skeleton; insect drawer).
So, a catalogued object can be considered an aggregation layer of one or many physical entities with an identifier (catalogue number).
