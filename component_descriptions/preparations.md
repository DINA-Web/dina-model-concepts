Component Description: Preparations
=======================

## Specific scope of the component
Collection information packages need to cope with preparations for supporting daily work of collection staff handling the collection objects.

## What does the component do? (envisioned feature set)
* document the preparation event(s), preparation type(s), preservation methods(s) of physical entity and/or catalogued object
* document the relation between the state

### Definition

Preparations are deliberate changes of the state of physical entities for a certain purpose. The most relevant purposes are: preservation, research, display/exhibition.
A preparation method could be constructive (e.g. mounting a skeleton), deconstructive (e.g. taking tissue samples) and without influence to the physical entity (e.g. cast from a bone).
A preparation is a mandatory component for collection objects and is optional for physical entities. When a physical entity becomes a catalogued object it always undergoes a preparation.
