Information Package Definition: _Taxonomy_
=======================

## General scope of the information package
This information package is dedicated for all functional components and information related to taxonomy. 

## Reason(s) for being standalone
Taxonomy is a separate research area so that dynamic changes in taxonomic knowledge and related metadata must be curated separately as a research oriented manner.
Using the taxonomic information for collection management is very important (e.g. in [determinations](/component_descriptions/determinations.md) and [sotrage](component_descriptions/storage.md). But at the same time the requirements on the management of collection data and the management of taxonomic information must not be confused. As this adds even higher complexity to the system.

## Which information should be accommodated in this information package?
This information package accomodates the different taxomoic views, and references accpording to the state of the knowledge necessary for the research with collections and can be linked from other modules in a way that the integrity of information for needed collection management do not break with the dynamically changing state of taxonomic knowledge.


## Which information does __not__ live in this information package?
