Information Package Definition: _Geography_
=======================

## General scope of the information package
This information package is dedicated for all functional components and information related to geographic information. 

## Reason(s) for being standalone
Geographic information and georeferences comprise a diverse area of knowledge with different information layers (e.g. historical, area types, administrative areas etc.) and related metadata resources must be curated separately in order to.
Using the geographic information for collection management is very important (e.g. in [collecting events](/component_descriptions/collecting_events.md)). But at the same time the requirements on the management of collection data and the management of geographic information must not be confused. As this adds even higher complexity to the system.

## Which information should be accommodated in this information package?
This information package accommodates the different geographic layers and references according to the state of the knowledge necessary for a comprehensive search of collections items and can be linked from other modules in a way that the integrity of information needed for collection management does not break with the constantly growing state of geographic information.
