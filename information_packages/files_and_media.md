Information Package Definition: _Files and Media_
=======================

## General scope of the information package
Computer files are common containers of content stored in a computer storage device. Managing collection data comprises also the management of content that is accommodated in computer files. For example images of colllection objects and documents associated with the digital collection object data are common use cases in which the content won't leave its file container due to the operability related to its (file) format. 

## Reason(s) for being standalone
Files are relevant for any concept within a collection management system because images and documents provide evidence for assertions, provenance and any kind of documentation for verbatim data. The metadata format, structure  and metadata content about the file object is independent from the entities they are attached to in the collection management system. In order to avoid redundant modelling and implementation the file objects and their metadata are generically accommodated in this separated information package.
