Information Package Definition: _Collection Objects_
=======================

## General scope of the information package
Management of physical collection objects and close metadata.

## Reason(s) for being standalone
Collection-holding institutions need inventories / catalogues of their objects independent from manifold use-cases in research, exhibitions etc. 
They need countable entries of their holdings and a single point for search of object related data.

* collection metadata
* object descriptions
* properties of the physical objects and collection units
* preparations

  * determination history
  * agents: owner, collector, determiner, donator, funder
  * provenance

## Which information does __not__ live in this information package?
