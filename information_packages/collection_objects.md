Information Package Definition: _Collection Objects_
=======================

## General scope of the information package
Management of physical collection objects and close metadata.

## Reason(s) for being standalone
Collection-holding institutions need inventories / catalogues of their objects independent from manifold use-cases in research, exhibitions etc. 
They need countable entries of their holdings and a single point for search of object related data.


## Which information should be accommodated in this information package?
* collection metadata
* management of [physical entities](component_descriptions/physical_entity.md) and [catalogued objects](component_descriptions/catalogued_object.md)
* management of properties / attributes of the physical entities and collection units
* [determinations](component_descriptions/determinations.md) history
* preparations and [preparation processes](component_descriptions/preparation_process.md)
* quantity and quality
* [transactions and requests](component_descriptions/transactions_and_requests.md)
* availability
* [storage](component_descriptions/storage.md)
* metadata on [collecting events](component_descriptions/collecting_event.md)
* __links__ to related information
  * agents: owner, collector, determiner, donator, funder
  * provenance
  * research data
  * literature
  * media
  * DNA
  * digitization metadata
  * [collecting events](component_descriptions/collecting_event.md)
  * ...

## Which information does __not__ live in this information package?
* observation data
* taxonomic research data (e.g. species traits)
* detailed information on the _linked_ entities
* project metadata 
* ...
